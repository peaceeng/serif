- Execution

```
// Install modules
npm i
// Download into local
node index.js
// Execute to open file and extract locations in New York PPO
node read.js
```

### Advantage

Now, using streaming technology to open large file and read line by line.

### Disadvantage

Using specific JSON structure, but it is not maintainable for the future in the case that structure will be changed.

It takes 167s to read and extract.
